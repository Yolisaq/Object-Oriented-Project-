# 🏗️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

## 📖 Overview
This assignment explores the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The goal is to design your own class, implement attributes and methods, and demonstrate key OOP concepts such as **constructors**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.

---

## 🛠️ Part 1: Design Your Own Class

### 🎯 Objective
Create a class representing any real-world or fictional entity (e.g., Smartphone 📱, Book 📚, or Superhero 🦸) and make it dynamic by adding attributes and methods.

### ✅ Requirements
- **Attributes:** Define key properties of the class 📝.
- **Methods:** Add behaviors/functions to bring the class to life ⚡.
- **Constructor (`__init__`)**: Initialize each object with unique values 🔑.
- **Inheritance:** Add at least one subclass to demonstrate OOP inheritance 👑.
- **Encapsulation:** Hide sensitive data using private attributes or methods 🔒.

### 📦 Deliverables
- A fully functional class with meaningful attributes and methods.
- Demonstration of inheritance and encapsulation.

---

## 🎭 Part 2: Polymorphism Challenge

### 🎯 Objective
Demonstrate **polymorphism** by creating multiple classes that share the same method name but implement it differently.

### ✅ Requirements
- Create **animals 🐶🐱 or vehicles 🚗✈️** with a `move()` method.
- Each class should implement `move()` in its own way 🔄.
- Showcase polymorphic behavior by iterating through objects and calling the same method 👀.

### 📦 Deliverables
- A program demonstrating polymorphism with multiple classes.
- A clear display of how the same method behaves differently depending on the object 🔄.

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Classes & Objects:** Encapsulation of attributes and behaviors 🏷️.
- **Constructors (`__init__`)**: Initialization of object properties ⚙️.
- **Inheritance:** Creating a subclass to extend or modify functionality 🧬.
- **Encapsulation:** Using private attributes to hide data 🔐.
- **Polymorphism:** Implementing the same method differently across multiple classes 🔄.

## 📝 How to Submit
1. Include a **README.md** file describing your project and OOP concepts 📂.
2. Ensure your Python program demonstrating the class and polymorphism is complete 🐍.
3. Submit the files as per the instructor’s guidelines 📤.
